## About Me
Hi! I am a final year master's student in Quantitative Data Science at the [University of TÃ¼bingen](https://www.uni-tuebingen.de/en.html). I currently work part-time as a research assistant at the [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](https://is.mpg.de/) where I focus on benchmarking large language models (LLMs) and integrating measurement theory into the fine-tuning process. Previously, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Economics. I started in data science with an internship at [Accenture Industrial Intelligence Suite](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/industries/industrial-equipment) , where I worked on analytics for an industrial project involving fine-blanked components. Later, I worked at [Bosch, Abstatt](https://www.bosch-engineering.com/de/unternehmen/standorte/abstatt.html) supervised by [Liza Dixon](https://lizadixon.com/) where I analyzed and modeled driving control inputs and pupil diameter to study driver responses during various interventions in a HMI study.
